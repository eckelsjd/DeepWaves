File transfer information

DeepWaves

Everything you need to know about the project is documented in the DeepWaves-doc.pdf file. All other documentation
files are included in the documentation folder.

The working directory structure for the project (as laid out in DeepWaves-doc.pdf) is different from the file storage
we are using to transfer all of the data. DeepWaves-doc.pdf lays out how the project should be setup on your system
to replicate all of the work from scratch using our source code files. 

The files being transferred are stored like this on our team Dropbox account:

/ansys -> ansys workbench project files
/CNN_models -> trained CNN model files
/conference -> documents and figures for the IMAC paper
/data -> all ANSYS exported data, geometry .step files, wavefield images, and segmentation masks we generated during the project
/documentation -> all documentation and instruction files (including DeepWaves-doc.pdf)
/presentations -> all interim presentations, experimental data LA-UR, and our final presentation
/research -> all of our journal articles and notes we gathered during the literature review
/src -> all source code files used to generate all of the data in the data directory

Erica, here are how these things apply to your requested list:

Code:
	-Location: 'src' directory
	-Size: 11.8 MB
	-Purpose: See DeepWaves-doc.pdf in documentation folder
Models:
	-Location: 'CNN_models' directory
	-Size: 2.48 GB
	-Purpose: trained CNN models. DeepWaves-doc.pdf for more information
Data:
	-Location: 'data' directory
	-Size: 34.2 GB
	-Purpose: Has all ANSYS data, MATLAB wavefield images, segmentation masks, and .step files
		  for round 1-8 simulations. Instructions included on how to make the augmented data.
Presentation:
	-Location: 'presentations' directory
	-Size: 100 MB
	-Purpose: Has all 3 interim presentations, experimental data pptx, and final presentation
Documents:
	-Location: 'documentation' directory and 'conference' directory
	-Size: 3 MB
	-Purpose: documentation directory has all notes and the DeepWaves-doc.pdf guide
		  conference directory will be location of final conference paper when completed
CNN Training:
	-See DeepWaves-doc.pdf
	-All training hyperparameters can be found in the unet_train.ipynb Jupyter notebooks
	-You'll want to open Jupyter notebooks after installing jupyter notebooks software
	-Or open them in Kaggle or Google Collab


Email us if you have any more questions. Paper is still in progress!
