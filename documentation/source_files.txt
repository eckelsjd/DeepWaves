# Instructions on how to use each source file

process_images.m
	- Install Matlab parallel computing toolbox and statistics toolbox
	- Choose 'mode' for plot_wavefield function
	- Run from src directory
	- Change 'parfor' loop to 'for' loop to use without parallel computing toolbox
	- This creates all real,imaginary,magnitude, and mask images
	- Depends on data,images,labels directories

plot_wavefield.m
	- Function ran from within process_images.m
	- Choose the 'mode' argument to determine how the masks are produced
	- See the source code for more description
	- Calls filter_defect.m

display_dir.m
	- Helper function to quickly iterate through and check segmentation masks
	- Run from src directory
	- Hit any button to iterate through the images
	- Images will be displayed in a Matlab figure

run_sims.py
	- Run this file as a script in Ansys 19.1 workbench
	- Gathers all .step files from the 'geometry' directory
	- Opens Mechanical and sends ACT_mech_script.py to be executed
	- Saves all result files in 'data' directory
	- Performs simulation on all of the .step files gathered
	- Runtime = 10 hours for 224 sims
	- Exported data contains node x,y,z info and z-displacement in a .txt file for real and imaginary displacement

run_matlab.py
	- Uses Matlab engine for Python to call plot_wavefield.m from run_sims.py
	- Automatically generates wavefield images and masks
	- Can also automatically move files to Dropbox account using Dropbox API

ACT_mech_script.py
	- ACT script run in Ansys Mechanical to set parameters and run simulation on plate geometry .step files

augment.py
	- Perform data augmentation to increase dataset size

noise.py
	- Generate several images with varying gaussian noise levels. (for a future noise study)

interpret.py
	- Customized fastai source code file for creating consistent colors in cnn prediction output images.
	- Follow the instructions in consistent_colors.txt to use this file.

CAD_scripts
	- This folder contains ANSYS ACT python scripts that can be run directly in the ACT console in SpaceClaim
	  to parametrically model and save many .step geometry files automatically
	- Use these scripts to aid in creating your own ACT modeling script (they won't work directly)
	- Also look into journal recording in SpaceClaim for help in finding useful Python commands

unet_train_0_004_KH.ipynb
	- Kelly Ho's training script with 0.004 Gaussian noise

unet_train_0_0009_KH.ipynb
	- Kelly Ho's training script with 0.0009 Gaussian noise

unet_train_JE.ipynb
	- Jupyter notebook to interactively train CNN model using fastai library
	- Joshua Eckels' training script

codes.txt and c_map.mat
	- stores class and color data used by source files

get_metrics.m
	- Calculates IoU metrics in Matlab and plots tables

make_figures.m
	- Generates colored pred and target images in matlab

unet_test.py and .ipynb
	- Python to run CNN inference on testset

test_iou.m
	- Test the accuracy of built-in matlab iou function

linspecer.m
	- Helper function from Matlab fileshare to generate
	  visually distinct colormaps for n classes
